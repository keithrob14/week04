<body>
    <div>
        <p>Here I made a paragraph tag inside of a div tag and then, like you, I placed <span>some text</span> in a <span>span tag.</span></p>
    </div>
        <p>This is content in a paragraph tag with <span>some text</span> in a <span>span tag</span><p> and this paragraph has no div.
        <p>I used the same text and html coding pattern in this as my last assignments.</p>
